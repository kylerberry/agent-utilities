# CRAFTS Workflow Skill

## When to use

Invoke this skill for every non-trivial task. Use the **full flow** for business logic, multi-file work, and anything crossing domain boundaries. Use the **lite flow** for config, scaffolding, and simple single-file fixes.

Start lite, then escalate to full if the task grows.

## Overview

CRAFTS is a sequential phase-gate workflow. Do not plan or execute phases in parallel per feature or issue; finish the current phase before moving to the next one.

Delegate each phase to its matching global subagent when the AgentSpawn tool is available, one call at a time. For medium/high work, C additionally invokes the independent `craft-security` plan-security checkpoint after the planner and before R. Wait for each report before proceeding, fixing blockers, or asking for clarification. Do not run CRAFTS subagents in parallel.

When exact per-spawn model selection is available, the R/F builder and A evaluator must run on different but equal-capability models. For example, if `craft-builder` runs on one frontier/coding-capable model, spawn `craft-evaluator` on a different peer model rather than the same model family. If the runtime only supports tier aliases, keep both at `medium` and explicitly note that exact model diversity could not be enforced in the phase report.

## Acceptance criteria provenance

Acceptance criteria may either be **provided as input** (by a human, an issue slice, or an upstream orchestrator that decomposed the work) or **absent**, in which case C authors them.

- **If criteria are provided:** treat them as ground truth. C does **not** re-author or reinterpret them — it plans and builds the test suite *against* them. Provided criteria are the independent reference used later in the Assess phase.
- **If no criteria are provided:** C authors acceptance criteria as part of Conceptualize, as before.

This distinction matters for review independence: when criteria have an author upstream of C, the Assess phase can check both the build *and* C's test suite against that original reference, catching interpretation drift. When C authors the criteria itself, no such upstream reference exists — Assess can only check internal consistency.

## Full Flow: C → R → A → F → T → S

### C — Conceptualize

Define scope, test cases, implementation plan, and risks before coding.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-planner"` for this phase when available. Pass the user request, relevant issue slice, repository constraints, any provided acceptance criteria, and any known blockers or ambiguities. Use its report as the gate artifact before moving to Render.

- Read the relevant issue slice or user request thoroughly.
- **If acceptance criteria were provided as input, treat them as ground truth — do not re-author. If none were provided, produce them.**
- Determine task complexity, scope boundaries, and whether the plan is fully actionable within the current context.
- If multi-step, create or update a todo list before coding.
- Produce: scope boundary, acceptance criteria (authored only if not provided), file list, test strategy, and risk assessment.
- Stop here if the plan is unclear — do not proceed to Render with ambiguous requirements.

### Elevated-risk plan-security checkpoint

C classifies every full-flow task as `low`, `medium`, or `high` risk. Medium and high use the same elevated controls. A task is elevated when it changes a trust boundary or handles untrusted input, authentication/authorization, secrets or sensitive data, external/network integration, file or command execution, CI/deploy permissions, or tenant isolation. C records the level, rationale, trust boundaries, assets, abuse cases, and planned security tests in its phase report.

For elevated work, invoke `craft-security` **after C and before R** in a fresh, independent context. It applies `security-and-hardening` to the plan, original criteria, risk declaration, and trust boundaries. This is a supplemental C checkpoint, not a new CRAFTS phase. Blocking plan findings return to C; Render begins only after the compact plan-security report passes. Pass that report to R, T, and S. Low-risk work skips this checkpoint.

**Global report contract:** global role reports are JSON, not prose. C includes `risk_level`, `risk_rationale`, `trust_boundaries`, `assets`, `abuse_cases`, and `planned_security_tests`. An elevated plan-security report includes `mode: "plan-security"`, `status: "passed" | "needs-replan"`, findings, required changes, and residual risk. Do not advance to R without `status: "passed"`. T includes `mode: "tighten"`, `status`, `trust_boundaries_reviewed`, `security_findings`, `security_commands`, and `residual_risk`; do not advance to S while it needs a fix. This is a portable report contract, not a claim of harness/schema enforcement.

### R — Render (Test-Drive)

Write failing tests first, then implement the minimum change to pass, then refactor.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-builder"` for this phase when available. Pass the C phase report and ask for test-first implementation guidance; for elevated work, also pass the required, passing plan-security report. Do not begin implementation until that report passes. When exact model selection is available, choose a model that has an equal-capability but different-model peer available for the later `craft-evaluator` spawn. Execute the implementation sequentially in the parent context after reviewing the subagent report.

- **Red:** write the failing test from the plan. If you can't write it, return to Conceptualize.
- **Green:** write the minimum implementation to pass. No more.
- **Refactor:** clean up without breaking green. Repeat for each test case.
- Run lint, type checks, and format when all tests pass.

### A — Assess

Review the diff for quality, reuse, efficiency, and type correctness.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-evaluator"` for this phase when available. Pass the task goal, **the original acceptance criteria (the provided/upstream version when one exists, not only C's derived plan)**, the CRAFTS plan, changed files, verification evidence, and the model used for `craft-builder`. When exact model selection is available, use a different but equal-capability model from the builder; if only tier aliases are available, keep `medium` and record the limitation. Treat blocking findings as inputs to Fix.

- **When original criteria are available, check the test suite itself against them — not just the code against the tests.** A suite that faithfully passes but misencodes the criteria is a blocking finding.
- Check for duplicated logic, missed edge cases, unclear naming.
- Verify type safety if applicable.
- Flag anything that should be fixed before proceeding.

### F — Fix

Address blocking issues from Assess. Re-run quality checks.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-builder"` for this phase when available. Pass only the blocking findings and relevant context so fixes remain minimal and scoped.

- High and medium severity first.
- Disagree with a finding? Document why instead of blindly fixing.

### T — Tighten

Apply `security-and-hardening` to the diff and fix findings.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-security"` for this phase when available. Pass the task goal, changed files, verification output, and any trust boundaries identified during Conceptualize or Render; for elevated work, also pass the C risk declaration and plan-security report.

- Apply the skill proportionately to the changed surface, not as a generic scan.
- For elevated work, account for every C trust boundary with evidence, a finding, or explicit non-applicability.
- Return blocking findings to F and repeat T after the fix.
- Require the global T JSON report defined above; an unstructured report is not a passing elevated-work gate.

### S — Sharpen

Capture durable lessons, gotchas, process updates, and any documentation changes so repo docs stay evergreen and aligned to code.

Use AgentSpawn with `subagent_type: "craft-sharpener"` for this phase when available. Pass the final diff summary, verification results, issue status, and any conventions or gotchas discovered during the task.

- Update the relevant domain docs (README, ADR, CLAUDE.md, PRD, ISSUES) with patterns established, gotchas discovered, conventions set during this task.
- If Tighten identifies a reusable security finding, record exactly one disposition: `guidance-update`, `owned-follow-up`, or `documented-non-generalizable`.
- Commit and push if applicable.

## Lite Flow: R → S

For clearly low-risk config, scaffolding, and simple single-file fixes. Escalate medium/high work to the full flow before editing so C can run the plan-security checkpoint:

1. **R — Render:** make the smallest correct change. Use `craft-builder` when AgentSpawn is available. Write or update tests if the codebase already has them.
2. **S — Sharpen:** capture any doc updates and commit. Use `craft-sharpener` when AgentSpawn is available.

## Escalation Rules

- Start lite. If the task grows beyond a single file or requires domain reasoning, escalate to full.
- Never skip Assess and Tighten on code that crosses a trust boundary or handles user input.

## Changelog (v2)

- Added **Acceptance criteria provenance** section: C authors criteria only when none are provided as input; provided criteria are treated as ground truth.
- **A phase** now receives the original/upstream criteria (when present) and is instructed to check the test suite against them, not just the code against the tests — closing the review-independence gap when criteria have an author upstream of C.
- Kept fully standalone-compatible: with no upstream criteria and no orchestrator, behavior is identical to v1.
